How do you think XML relates to HTML?
I think that XML is a parent language to HTML. HTML adds additional features to XML and has more
specific context.
What are some benefits of something like HTML using XML's syntax?
HTML doesn't have to reinvent the wheel. HTML becomes a natural evolution of XML. It works well as
a web development tool.
What are some disadvantages?
HTML isn't pratical outside of Web Development. HTML has likely inherited some flaws of XML.
